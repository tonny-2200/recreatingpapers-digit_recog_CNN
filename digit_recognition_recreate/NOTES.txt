In this digit recognition project using the MNIST dataset, a CNN model was recreated based on a research paper to achieve high accuracy. The model architecture begins with an input layer for grayscale images of size 28x28, followed by a series of convolutional layers with 16 and 64 filters respectively. Each convolutional layer utilizes the ReLU activation function, improving feature extraction while maintaining computational efficiency. Batch normalization layers are applied to stabilize and accelerate the training process. After two Conv2D layers, a MaxPooling layer downsamples the feature maps, reducing dimensionality and enhancing computational efficiency. A Dropout layer with a rate of 0.25 helps mitigate overfitting at this stage. The model then flattens the data before a fully connected Dense layer with 256 units and ReLU activation further processes the features. Another Dropout layer with a rate of 0.5 is included here for additional regularization, followed by a final Dense layer with softmax activation to output probabilities for each of the 10 digit classes.

Experiments with different activation functions (ReLU, sigmoid, and tanh) and a learning rate of 0.0001 yielded train and validation accuracies close to 99%, with ReLU performing slightly better overall. Graphs were plotted to visualize the effect of varying learning rates on model accuracy and loss, offering insights into the optimal configurations for this digit recognition task.
